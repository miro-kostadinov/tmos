 * @section dcrs 		DCR control codes processing
 *
 * @par DCR_OPEN
 * When a client tries to open a handle, the kernel calls the driver's DCR with
 * DCR_OPEN
 * The driver must set hnd->res to RES_OK if the handle can be open
 *
 * @par DCR_CANCEL
 * This control is sent when the client wants to cancel the handle operation.
 * Usually the client first checks for FLG_BUSY and only if it is set it calls
 * cancel(). But there is a time between the check and the call in which an
 * interrupt can complete the operation. So when the driver receives DCR_CANCEL
 * the operation may or may not be completed.
 *
 * The driver should do nothing if there is no operation in progress (FLG_BUSY
 * can be checked if necessarily). The driver can also ignore this control code
 * if no cancellation mechanism is supported.
 * When it is possible to cancel the operation, the driver must set status with
 * FLG_SIGNALED. If there is some data transfered the FLG_OK must also be set.
 *
 *
 * @section dsrs 		DSR processing
 *
 * The driver DSR() function is called when a client requests some handle
 * operation.
 *
 * @par Handle operations
 * Most common handle operations are simple read and write. These operations are
 * signaled with FLG_READ and FLG_WRITE respectively in the hnd->cmd field.
 * Some drivers may support simultaneous read and write (swap) operation.
 * Another simple operation is a Command that can be requested with FLG_COMMAND.
 * The command operation is a driver specific operation and not every driver can
 * support it.
 *
 * In addition to the basic operations, the client can set FLG_LOCK. This makes
 * the basic operation exclusive in some way. Typically, when a lock operation
 * is requested, the driver must lock to the this client and will not start
 * requests from other clients.
 * In this way a client can perform a sequence of transactions without being
 * interrupted from other clients. To end the sequence the client must request a
 * normal operation (without FLG_LOCK).
 *
 * The lock flag may also have side effects. For example when a lock operations
 * is requested from the SPI driver, it asserts the chip select (specified in
 * the mode) and keeps it asserted for the whole sequence.
 * Many SPI devices (flashes, LCDs etc) require a complete command sequence in
 * single CS assertion. The command usually has a header and then the real data.
 * If this has to be done in a single read/write the header and the data must be
 * consequent in the memory which usually is not the case. However with a lock
 * sequence there is no problem. First the header can be transferred and then
 * the data with another request. The requests from the client with two memory
 * blocks, but to the SPI device they appear a single transaction.
 *
 * @subsection dsr_hnd_res Status update
 * In the first release of the driver system, the drivers had to set the status
 * and signal the client only. This approach is OK for simple algorithms where
 * the client makes a request and waits for a signal.
 * The practice showed however that it is source for bugs and problems if the
 * client by mistake places a second operation with the same handle while the
 * driver is still working on the first request. Also sometimes the client can
 * try to free the handle in the cleanup and has no record if there is pending
 * operation with that handle. To solve such problems the drivers update few
 * flags in hnd->res so the clients can have reliable information about the
 * handle status.
 *
 * @par FLG_BUSY
 * The driver's DSR() must set FLG_BUSY if the handle processing will continue
 * after the function return.
 * While the handle is busy the client can only try to cancel, and it should not
 * do anything else. In fact the client does not have to check this flag. It is
 * checked internally in the CHandle methods.
